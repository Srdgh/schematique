# schematique
Graphviz preprocessor for simpler flowcharting

# Aims

In order of importance/general interest:
- automate word-wrap
- simplify syntax (trade some flexibility for readability)
- enable a powerful "format presets" system. (e.g. tag a node with `{objection}` for a red border, tag it with `{support}` for a green border, etc.)
